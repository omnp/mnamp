# Utilities used for development

Here one can find a python script which mimics the operation of the filters and the "amp" code.

Edit as needed and run with:


    python process-cffi.py

(If having built the plugin library which should be found under ../build/mnamp.lv2/, see the script file for details.)

Apart from standard python modules, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot are needed.
